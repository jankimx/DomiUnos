Our program has changed a lot through its graphical design.

We first planned to use keyboard listener for our user interface; however, we realized halfway through that there is a chance that one user would have more than 10 dominos, and that would surpass the number of keys that would correspond appropriately with more than 10 dominos. For example, we would not have a key that responds to domino #11 in a player's hand that is user friendly. We thought of using the period or some other letter to represent any domino that is greater than 10, but we found that using MouseAdapter would make it more user friendly and sophisiticated. We found the areas that the user could click to choose a domino and the user would be able to click on the area that the user desires to place the domino. The domino would stick if the domino fits correctly in the space (i.e. if one of the sides of the domino matches the previous domino).

Another problem that we ran into was the sizing of the dominos when they were placed on the table of dominos. When placing the dominos at first, the dominos would go off the screen. So, we decided to either implement a horizonal scrolling mechanism or just making the dominos smaller. In the end, we decided to implement both so that the dominos were not so small that the user could not see them. It ended up looking a lot better with both changes.
