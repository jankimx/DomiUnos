DomiUnos Rules:
  1. 2 players (alternating turns)
  2. To start, each player is given 7 dominos
  3. Yellow dominos mean skip and green dominos indicate draw another tile
  4. If Player one sets down a yellow domino (if it fits), then Player two's turn is skipped
  5. If Player one sets down a green domino (if it fits), then Player two must draw another tile from the shuffled pile
  6. Player one goes first, playing any domino he wishes from his/her hand by clicking and dragging his or her domino
  7. Each turn a player lays the dominoes end to end (the touching ends must match: i.e., one’s touch one’s, two’s touch two’s, etc.)
  8. The player is to click the desired domino and drag the tile to the area he or she wants to place the domino
  9. If a player cannot make another move with their tile, they must draw a domino until they can place one unless there are no more tiles to draw from. If the latter is true, then the other player places their tile.
  10. The round ends when either no more moves are left to make (all tiles used) or one of the players does not have any tiles left in his/her pile.
  11. Game ends when one player gets 100 points with as many rounds as needed
  12. Whoever gets 100 points first loses
