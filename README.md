2. To start, each player is given 7 dominos
3. Red dominos mean skip and blue dominos indicate draw another tile
4. If Player 1 sets down a red domino (if it fits), then Player 2's turn is skipped
5. If Player 1 sets down a blue domino (if it fits), then Player 2 must draw another tile from the shuffled pile
6. The player who drew the highest double or the highest domino plays first, playing any domino he wishes from his/her hand
7. Each turn a player lays the dominoes end to end (the touching ends must match: i.e., one’s touch one’s, two’s touch two’s, etc.)
8. The player is to click the desired domino and click the area he or she wants to place the domino
9. If a player cannot make another move with their tile, they must draw a domino until they can place one unless there are no more tiles to draw from. If the latter is true, then the other player places their tile.
